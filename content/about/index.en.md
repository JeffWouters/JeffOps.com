# My blog
Well, here it is; My blog. I hope you’ll find it useful or even that I can help you out with my content for whatever problem you’re facing. If you have any questions or remarks, please let me know.

Just to give you a fair warning: I tend to be very direct, politically incorrect and sometimes people feel that I'm downright rude. However, with only very few exceptions, I never do this with the intention to harm or hurt anyone.

If I've offended you in any way, I ask that you think about it first:  
  
In case you ARE offended => Please tell me how I caused this so that I better myself and not do it again, and of course so that I can appologize to you.  
In case you FEEL offended => Suck it up, buttercup. Grow a spine, and please don't bother me with your issues.

# The content
You'll may notice that the content goes from Ops to Dev and back. Why is this? Well, I started my carreer in Ops, started automating my own work and eventually the work of others. Then my certain situations gave me the chance to embrace processed and methodologies related to Dev, and eventually I actually started doing some junior Dev work. Fast-forward a few years and now I'm ready to share what I've learned and continue to learn every day. And for fun I'll throw some coaching and management content in there every now and then.

# Other locations
You can find my content on other locations, specifically social media.
