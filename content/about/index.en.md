# This Blog
Welcome to my blog. I hope you’ll find it useful, and hopefully my content can help you with whatever problem you’re facing. Should you have any questions or remarks, don’t hesitate to contact me. 

To give you a fair warning; I’m Dutch.
This means I tend to be direct, sometimes with a dash of politically incorrect humor, but I never intent to be rude or harmful. If you find I’ve offended you in any way, please let me know so I can apologize to you and better myself.

# The Content
You may notice that my content goes from Ops to Dev and back again. I’ve started my career in Ops, started automating my own work and eventually that of others, and certain situations gave me the chance to embrace processes and methodologies related to Dev, so I actually started doing some junior Dev work. Fast forward a few years and now I’m ready to share what I’ve learned so far, and what I continue to learn each day. For fun I might throw in some coaching and management content every now and then.
